# SpotifyToiTunes
Python script to conver Spotify exported playlists to iTunes format

## Warning

(July 2, 2015) Currently, when you add a playlist to iTunes, it doesn't automatically search for songs in the Apple Music library. So if you haven't added some of the songs to your library, iTunes won't recognise them and won't add them to your playlist.

## Usage

Use Exportify to export your Spotify playlists
https://rawgit.com/watsonbox/exportify/master/exportify.html

Make sure to add "Spotify" to at the beginning of the playlist name

Put the playlists and SpotifyToiTunes.py in the same directory

Run 'python SpotifyToiTunes.py'

New iTunes playlist files will be created using the playlist file names without "Spotify"
